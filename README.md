# Intelligent Document Query System

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent document query system using LangChain, Python, and OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo. The system enables users to interactively retrieve information from documents through natural language queries.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for advanced NLP, enabling users to query documents using everyday language.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface design facilitates seamless switching between PDF documents, enhancing the user experience.

- **Dynamic PDF Switching:** Users can easily switch between different PDFs, making the system adaptable to various document sources.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The codebase follows OOP principles for modularity, error handling, and efficient integration with external APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **API Key Setup:** Obtain an OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API key and set it as an environment variable or pass it as a parameter during system initialization.

3. **Run the System:** Execute the main script, providing the initial PDF file path and API key when prompted. Follow on-screen instructions for querying and switching PDFs.

## Usage

- To ask a question, type the question when prompted.
- Type 'switch' to change the current PDF document.
- Type 'exit' to end the chat.

## Dependencies

- LangChain
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
- PyPDFLoader

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the developers of LangChain, OpenAI, and PyPDFLoader for their valuable contributions to this project.
